In this project, we are going to automate a few tasks with a spreadsheet.

The app needs to be able to read a spreadsheet, do some calculations with its data and update the spreadsheet with a new column.
Here's what it needs to do:

1) List each company with their respective product count
2) List products with inventory less than 10
3) List each company with respective total inventory value
4) Write to spreadsheet: calculate and write inventory value for each product into spreadsheet
